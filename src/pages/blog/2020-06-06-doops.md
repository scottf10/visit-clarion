Clarion County is home to several of the most exciting town celebrations. Whether you visit in early spring or late fall, there is sure to be a festival just around the corner suitable for fun, family and flickering feelings. The city of Clarion itself hosts a nine day long Autumn Leaf Festival at the end of September to celebrate the changing of the leaves and the start of a new season. If you visit during the late summer, you may be able to catch the Knox Horsethief Days: a weeklong celebration of Sebastian "Boss" Buck and other renowned horse thieves. September also brings you the Peanut Butter Festival in New Bethlehem. Filled with adventure and activities, not to mention locally made peanut butter, New Bethlehem hosts an exciting, jam packed weekend! Visit Clarion County during almost any month of the year to learn a little more about the county, its traditions, and the people who call it home.
