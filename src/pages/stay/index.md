description: "Rolling mountains, deeps valleys, and lazy rivers: Clarion County
  has it all. Just choose any of six exits along Interstate 80 to stop and enjoy
  nature. Each exit boasts a scenic drive through woods, farm land, and along
  rivers to a small town filled with great eats, stays and adventures. If you're
  looking for a little revitalization, look no further. Clarion County has all
  you need. Cabins in the woods, miles of hiking trails, or a kayak ride down
  the river: this is the place to recharge, renew, and come out refreshed."
